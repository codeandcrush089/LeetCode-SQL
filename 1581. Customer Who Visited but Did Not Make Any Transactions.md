```sql
-- Solution to find the IDs of customers who visited without making any transactions,
-- and count the number of such visits.

SELECT
    V.customer_id,
    COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM
    Visits V
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id
WHERE
    -- Filter for visits that did not have any corresponding transaction.
    -- If a visit has no transaction, the transaction_id column from the LEFT JOIN will be NULL.
    T.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY
    V.customer_id
-- Sorting is optional but can be useful for readability. The requirement states 'any order', so no ORDER BY is strictly needed.
