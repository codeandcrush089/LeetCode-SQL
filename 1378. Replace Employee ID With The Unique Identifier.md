```sql
-- Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, 
-- If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

-- We use a LEFT JOIN starting from the Employees table (E) 
-- to ensure that every employee is included in the result set.
-- If an employee's ID does not exist in EmployeeUNI (EU), 
-- the columns from EU (specifically unique_id) will automatically be NULL.
SELECT
    EU.unique_id,
    E.name
FROM
    Employees AS E
LEFT JOIN
    EmployeeUNI AS EU ON E.id = EU.id;
```
