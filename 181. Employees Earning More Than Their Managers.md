```sql
SELECT
    -- Select the name of the employee (E)
    E.name AS Employee
FROM
    Employee E -- E represents the employee
INNER JOIN
    Employee M ON E.managerId = M.id -- M represents the manager
WHERE
    -- Filter for cases where the employee's salary is strictly greater than the manager's salary
    E.salary > M.salary;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM Employee E`**

* `E` represents each employee row.


### **2. Self-join to get the manager**

```sql
INNER JOIN Employee M ON E.managerId = M.id
```

* Matches the employee (`E`) with their manager (`M`) using:

  * `E.managerId` → manager's ID stored on the employee row
  * `M.id` → manager's actual record

This gives access to the manager’s salary.


### **3. Filter employees who earn more than their manager**

```sql
E.salary > M.salary
```

Returns only employees whose salary is **greater than** their manager’s.


### **4. Select the employee name**

```sql
SELECT E.name AS Employee
```

Outputs only the names of those employees.
