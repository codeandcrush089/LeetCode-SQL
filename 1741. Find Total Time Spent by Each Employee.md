```sql
SELECT
    event_day AS day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) AS total_time
FROM
    Employees

## 🧐 Query Explanation

* `event_day AS day` → Renames **event_day** column to **day**.
* `out_time - in_time` → Calculates **working time for one entry**.
* `SUM(...)` → Adds up **total working time per employee per day**.
* `GROUP BY event_day, emp_id` → Groups data **by day and by employee**.
* `ORDER BY event_day, emp_id` → Sorts results by **day first, then employee ID**.
