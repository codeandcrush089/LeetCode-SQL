# Problem 1435: Create a Session Bar Chart
![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT '[0-5>' AS bin,
  SUM(duration <= 300) AS total
FROM Sessions
UNION ALL
SELECT '[5-10>' AS bin,
  SUM(
    duration > 300
    AND duration <= 600
  ) AS total
FROM Sessions
UNION ALL
SELECT '[10-15>' AS bin,
  SUM(
    duration > 600
    AND duration <= 900
  ) AS total
FROM Sessions
UNION ALL
SELECT '15 or more' AS bin,
  SUM(duration > 900) AS total
FROM Sessions
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

* Each `SELECT` creates a **time bin** for session duration.
* `SUM(condition)` → Counts how many rows **satisfy the condition** (because true = 1, false = 0).

**Bins explained:**

* `[0-5>` → `duration <= 300` → Sessions **0–5 minutes**.

* `[5-10>` → `300 < duration <= 600` → Sessions **5–10 minutes**.

* `[10-15>` → `600 < duration <= 900` → Sessions **10–15 minutes**.

* `15 or more` → `duration > 900` → Sessions **above 15 minutes**.

* `UNION ALL` → Combines all bin results **into one output table**.
