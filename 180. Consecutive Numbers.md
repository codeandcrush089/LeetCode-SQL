# Problem 180 Consecuive Numbers
![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Medium-yellow)

```sql
SELECT
    -- Select the distinct number that appears consecutively three times
    DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs L1,
    Logs L2,
    Logs L3
WHERE
    -- L2 is the row immediately following L1 (id + 1)
    L1.id = L2.id - 1
    -- L3 is the row immediately following L2 (id + 2 relative to L1)
    AND L2.id = L3.id - 1
    -- Check that the number in L1 is the same as the number in L2
    AND L1.num = L2.num
    -- Check that the number in L2 is the same as the number in L3
    AND L2.num = L3.num;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. Self-joining the table three times**

```sql
Logs L1, Logs L2, Logs L3
```

* `L1` → first row
* `L2` → second row (next)
* `L3` → third row (next)


### **2. Enforcing consecutive row order**

```sql
L1.id = L2.id - 1
L2.id = L3.id - 1
```

This ensures:

* L2 comes immediately after L1
* L3 comes immediately after L2
  So the rows represent **three consecutive entries**.


### **3. Ensuring the same number appears in all three rows**

```sql
L1.num = L2.num
AND L2.num = L3.num
```

So the values are identical across these consecutive rows.


### **4. Returning the number**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT L1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
```

`DISTINCT` is used to avoid duplicates if overlapping sequences occur.
