## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. Subquery**

```sql
SELECT num
FROM MyNumbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
```

* Groups rows by `num`.
* Keeps only numbers that appear **exactly once** (single numbers).


### **2. `WHERE num IN (subquery)`**

Filters the main table to include **only those single-occurrence numbers**.


### **3. `MAX(num) AS num`**

Finds the **largest value** among the numbers that appear only once.
