## 💡 Query Explanation (Pivoting)

1.  **`GROUP BY id`**: This groups all records belonging to the same department, ensuring we get a single output row for each unique department ID.
2.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'MonthName' THEN revenue ELSE NULL END)`**: This is the core of the pivot operation:
      * For each department group, the `CASE` statement checks the value of the `month` column.
      * If the month matches (e.g., `'Jan'`), it returns the `revenue` value for that row.
      * If the month does **not** match, it returns `NULL`.
      * The **`SUM()`** aggregate function then adds up all the returned values. Since there is a primary key constraint on `(id, month)`, there will only be one non-null `revenue` value per month within each department group, so `SUM(revenue)` simply returns that single revenue amount. If all values are `NULL` (meaning no revenue was recorded for that month), the sum correctly results in `NULL`.

This effectively transforms the rows (months) into columns (`Jan_Revenue`, `Feb_Revenue`, etc.).
