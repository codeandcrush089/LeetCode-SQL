## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM SalesPerson s`**

Uses the `SalesPerson` table as the base and considers **all salespersons**.


### **2. Subquery (sales who worked with RED)**

```sql
SELECT o.sales_id
FROM Orders o
JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
WHERE c.name = 'RED'
```

* Joins `Orders` with `Company`.
* Filters orders made for the company named **'RED'**.
* Returns the `sales_id` values of salespersons who handled those orders.


### **3. `s.sales_id NOT IN (subquery)`**

Excludes any salesperson whose ID appears in the subquery result
→ removes salespersons who **sold to RED**.


### **4. `SELECT s.name`**

Outputs the **names of salespersons** who never sold to RED.
