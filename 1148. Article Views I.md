```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    author_id AS id
FROM
    Views
WHERE
    author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY
    id ASC;
```


### 💡 Breakdown of the Query

1.  **`WHERE author_id = viewer_id`**: This is the core filter. It identifies all rows in the `Views` table where the author of the article is the same person as the viewer of the article (an author viewing their own work).
2.  **`SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id`**: Since an author might view their own article multiple times (or view multiple of their own articles), we use **`DISTINCT`** to ensure each unique author ID is reported only once. We alias `author_id` as `id` to match the required output column name.
3.  **`ORDER BY id ASC`**: This sorts the final result set by the author ID in ascending order, as requested.
