![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT
    date_id,
    make_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id) AS unique_leads,
    COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id) AS unique_partners
FROM
    DailySales
GROUP BY
    date_id,
    make_name;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

* `date_id, make_name` → Groups data by **date** and **company (make)**.
* `COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id)` → Counts the **number of unique leads** per date & make.
* `COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id)` → Counts the **number of unique partners** per date & make.
* `GROUP BY date_id, make_name` → Ensures counts are calculated **separately for each date and make**.
