## 🧐 Query Explanation


* **First SELECT**

  * `Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries` → Keeps all employees.
  * `WHERE Salaries.salary IS NULL` → Finds employees **who have no salary record**.

* **Second SELECT**

  * `Salaries LEFT JOIN Employees` → Keeps all salary records.
  * `WHERE Employees.name IS NULL` → Finds salaries **assigned to non-existing employees**.

* `UNION ALL` → Combines both missing cases **without removing duplicates**.

* `ORDER BY 1` → Sorts output by **employee_id**.
