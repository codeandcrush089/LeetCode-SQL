![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT
    C.name AS Customers
FROM
    Customers C
-- Start with all customers on the left side
LEFT JOIN
    Orders O ON C.id = O.customerId
-- Filter to keep only those rows where there was NO matching order.
-- When a customer has no orders, the columns from the Orders table (O) will be NULL.
WHERE
    O.id IS NULL;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM Customers C`**

Starts with the **Customers** table so every customer is considered.


### **2. `LEFT JOIN Orders O ON C.id = O.customerId`**

Attempts to match each customer with their orders.

* If a customer has orders → matching rows exist.
* If a customer has no orders → `Orders` columns become **NULL**.


### **3. `WHERE O.id IS NULL`**

Keeps only customers **without any orders** (no matching row in `Orders`).


### **4. `SELECT C.name AS Customers`**

Outputs the **names of customers** who never placed an order.
