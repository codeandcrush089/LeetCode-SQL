### **2. `GROUP BY customer_number`**

Groups all orders by each customer so orders are counted **per customer**.


### **3. `COUNT(order_number)`**

Counts how many orders each customer has placed.


### **4. `ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC`**

Sorts customers by **number of orders**, highest first.


### **5. `LIMIT 1`**

Returns **only the customer with the most orders**.
