![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT
    EU.unique_id,
    E.name
FROM
    Employees AS E
LEFT JOIN
    EmployeeUNI AS EU ON E.id = EU.id;
```
---
## 🧐 Query Explanation

* **`FROM Employees AS E`**
  Starts with the **Employees** table so **every employee** appears in the output.

* **`LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI AS EU ON E.id = EU.id`**
  Joins employee records with their **unique ID**, if available.

  * If the employee’s ID **exists** in `EmployeeUNI` → `unique_id` is shown.
  * If it **does not exist** → `unique_id` becomes **NULL** (because of LEFT JOIN).

* **`SELECT EU.unique_id, E.name`**
  Retrieves:

  * The employee’s **unique ID** (or NULL if not found)
  * The employee’s **name**
