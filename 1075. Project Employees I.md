```sql
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM
    Project p
JOIN
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY
    p.project_id;
```


### 💡 Breakdown of the Query

1.  **`FROM Project p JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id`**: This step combines the `Project` and `Employee` tables. The join is performed on the common column, **`employee_id`**, which links employees to the projects they are working on and retrieves their experience years.
2.  **`GROUP BY p.project_id`**: This groups the joined rows by **`project_id`**, so the subsequent aggregate function (`AVG`) is calculated independently for each unique project.
3.  **`AVG(e.experience_years)`**: This calculates the **average** of the `experience_years` for all employees within each project group.
4.  **`ROUND(..., 2) AS average_years`**: This function takes the calculated average and rounds it to **2 decimal places**, aliasing the resulting column as `average_years` to match the required output.
