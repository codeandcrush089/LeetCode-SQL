# Problem 608: Tree Node
![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Medium-yellow)

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    CASE
        -- 1. Root Node: The parent ID (p_id) is NULL.
        WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        -- 2. Leaf Node: The node's ID does NOT appear in the set of all parent IDs (p_id column).
        WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Leaf'
        -- 3. Inner Node: If it's neither Root (p_id IS NOT NULL) nor Leaf (id IS in the p_id set).
        ELSE 'Inner'
    END AS type
FROM
    Tree
ORDER BY
    id;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM Tree`**

Reads all nodes from the `Tree` table.


### **2. `CASE` expression**

Classifies each node into a type:

* **Root**

  ```sql
  WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
  ```

  Node has no parent.

* **Leaf**

  ```sql
  WHEN id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT p_id FROM Tree WHERE p_id IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Leaf'
  ```

  Node never appears as a parent → has **no children**.

* **Inner**

  ```sql
  ELSE 'Inner'
  ```

  Node has a parent **and** at least one child.



### **3. `SELECT id, type`**

Returns each node’s ID and its computed type.

### **4. `ORDER BY id`**

Sorts the output by node ID.
