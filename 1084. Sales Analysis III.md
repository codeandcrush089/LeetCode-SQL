## 🧐 Query Explanation

This solution uses a **`GROUP BY`** clause in combination with the **`HAVING`** clause to filter products based on their entire sale history.

1.  **`FROM Product p JOIN Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id`**: We join the `Product` table with the `Sales` table to access both the product name and the sale dates.
2.  **`GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name`**: We group the results by product. This allows us to use aggregate functions (`MIN`, `MAX`) to check the range of sale dates for *each* product.
3.  **`HAVING ...`**: The `HAVING` clause filters the groups (i.e., the products) based on a condition applied to aggregated values. The two conditions ensure that **all** sales for a product fall within the first quarter of 2019:
      * **`MIN(s.sale_date) >= '2019-01-01'`**: Ensures the **earliest** sale date for the product is on or after the start of Q1 2019. (This filters out products sold before Q1 2019).
      * **`MAX(s.sale_date) <= '2019-03-31'`**: Ensures the **latest** sale date for the product is on or before the end of Q1 2019. (This is the crucial step that filters out products that were *also* sold after Q1 2019, like product ID 2 in the example).

Since the minimum and maximum sale dates are within the first quarter, all sales for that product must also have occurred within that period.
