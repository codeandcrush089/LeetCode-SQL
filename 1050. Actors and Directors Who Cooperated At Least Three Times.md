## 🧐 Query Explanation

### 1. `SELECT actor_id, director_id`

Selects the **actor–director pairs** that satisfy the condition.


### 2. `FROM ActorDirector`

Reads data from the **ActorDirector** table containing collaboration records.


### 3. `GROUP BY actor_id, director_id`

Groups rows by **each unique combination of actor and director**, so each pair is treated as one group.


### 4. `COUNT(*)`

Counts how many times **each actor–director pair appears** in the table (i.e., number of collaborations).


### 5. `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3`

Filters and keeps only those actor–director pairs that have **worked together at least 3 times**.
