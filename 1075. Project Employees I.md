## 🧐 Query Explanation


### 1. `SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years`

Selects each **project ID** and calculates the **average experience (in years)** of employees working on that project, rounded to **2 decimal places**.


### 2. `FROM Project p`

Uses the **Project** table as the base table with alias **`p`**.


### 3. `JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id`

Joins the **Employee** table with the **Project** table using the **matching employee_id** to link each project with its employees.


### 4. `AVG(e.experience_years)`

Computes the **average experience of employees** for each project.


### 5. `ROUND(..., 2)`

Rounds the calculated average to **two decimal places** for cleaner output.


### 6. `GROUP BY p.project_id`

Groups all records by **project ID** so the average is calculated **per project**.
