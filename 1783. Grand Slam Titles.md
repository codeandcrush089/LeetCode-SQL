```sql
SELECT
  Players.player_id,
  Players.player_name,
  SUM(Players.player_id = Championships.Wimbledon) + SUM(Players.player_id = Championships.Fr_open) + SUM(Players.player_id = Championships.US_open) + SUM(Players.player_id = Championships.Au_open) AS grand_slams_count
FROM Players
INNER JOIN Championships
  ON (
    Players.player_id IN (
      Championships.Wimbledon,
      Championships.Fr_open,
      Championships.US_open,
      Championships.Au_open
    )
  )
GROUP BY 1;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

* `INNER JOIN Championships` → Matches players who won **any Grand Slam** tournament.
* `IN (Wimbledon, Fr_open, US_open, Au_open)` → Checks if the player won **any of the four slams**.
* `SUM(Players.player_id = Championships.Wimbledon)` → Counts **Wimbledon wins** for the player.
* Same `SUM(...)` logic for **French Open, US Open, Australian Open**.
* Adding all four `SUM()` values → Gives **total Grand Slam titles**.
* `GROUP BY 1` → Groups results by **player_id**.
