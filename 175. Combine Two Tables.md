```sql
SELECT
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

## 🧐 Query Explanation

* **`FROM Person p`**
  Starts with the `Person` table so **every person appears**, even if they have no address.

* **`LEFT JOIN Address a ON p.personId = a.personId`**
  Matches each person to their address.

  * If the person has an address → city and state are filled.
  * If not → city and state are **NULL**.

* **`SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state`**
  Shows the person's name along with their city and state.
