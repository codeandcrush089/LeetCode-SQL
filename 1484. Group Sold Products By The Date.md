## 🧐 Query Explanation


### **1. `SELECT sell_date`**

Shows each date on which products were sold.



### **2. Count unique products**

```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold
```

Counts how many **different products** were sold on each date.



### **3. Create a comma-separated list of product names**

```sql
GROUP_CONCAT(
    DISTINCT product
    ORDER BY product ASC
    SEPARATOR ','
) AS products
```

* Takes the **unique product names** sold on that date
* Sorts them **alphabetically**
* Combines them into a **single comma-separated string**

Example output:
`keyboard,mouse,monitor`



### **4. `FROM Activities`**

Uses sales data from the `Activities` table.



### **5. `GROUP BY sell_date`**

Aggregates results **per date**.


### **6. `ORDER BY sell_date`**

Sorts output chronologically.
