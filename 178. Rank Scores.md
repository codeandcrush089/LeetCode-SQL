# Problem 178: Rank Scores
![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Medium-yellow)

```sql
SELECT
    score,
    -- DENSE_RANK() assigns a rank to each row within a partition (none specified here, so the whole table).
    -- It assigns the same rank to tied values and leaves no gaps in the ranking sequence.
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
FROM
    Scores
ORDER BY
    score DESC;
```
---
## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `SELECT score`**

Returns each score from the `Scores` table.



### **2. Ranking the scores**

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS 'rank'
```

* `DENSE_RANK()` assigns ranking numbers:

  * Higher scores → **lower rank number** (1 is highest).
  * Tied scores get the **same rank**.
  * **No gaps** in ranking numbers.

    * Example: scores = 100, 90, 90, 80
      → ranks = 1, 2, 2, 3



### **3. `ORDER BY score DESC`**

Sorts the final output from **highest score to lowest**, matching the ranking order.
