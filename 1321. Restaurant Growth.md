## 🧐 Query Explanation


* **`DailyTotal` CTE**

  * Groups by `visited_on` and computes `daily_amount` = **total money spent by all customers per day**.

* **`MovingAverageCalc` CTE**

  * Uses window functions over `daily_amount`:

    * `SUM(daily_amount) OVER (ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`
      → **7-day total amount** (current day + previous 6 days).
    * `AVG(daily_amount) OVER (same window)`
      → **7-day moving average**, rounded to 2 decimals.
    * `MIN(visited_on) OVER ()`
      → First date in the data, used to know from when a **full 7-day window** is possible.

* **Final SELECT + WHERE**

  * Keeps only rows where `visited_on` is at least **6 days after the first date** → ensures a **full 7-day window** exists.
  * Returns: `visited_on`, 7-day **sum** (`amount`), and 7-day **average** (`average_amount`).
