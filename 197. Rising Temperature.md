```sql
SELECT
    W1.id
FROM
    Weather W1,
    Weather W2
WHERE
    
    DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1

## 🧐 Query Explanation


### **1. `FROM Weather W1, Weather W2`**

Creates a **self-join** on the `Weather` table:

* `W1` → today’s record
* `W2` → yesterday’s record



### **2. `DATEDIFF(W1.recordDate, W2.recordDate) = 1`**

Ensures that `W1` is **exactly one day after** `W2`, so we are comparing **consecutive days**.



### **3. `W1.temperature > W2.temperature`**

Checks whether today’s temperature is **higher than yesterday’s**.



### **4. `SELECT W1.id`**

Returns the **ID of the day** where the temperature increased.
