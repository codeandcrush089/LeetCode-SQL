### 💡 Breakdown of the Query

1.  **`FROM Users u LEFT JOIN Orders o ON u.user_id = o.buyer_id`**:

      * We start with the `Users` table because we need to include **all** users, even those who made zero orders (like users 3 and 4 in the example).
      * We use a **`LEFT JOIN`** to include every row from `Users` (`u`) and match it with corresponding orders from the `Orders` table (`o`). The join is done on `u.user_id = o.buyer_id` since we are only counting orders made *as a buyer*.

2.  **`GROUP BY u.user_id, u.join_date`**:

      * We group the results by `user_id` and `join_date` so that we can calculate the aggregate count for each individual user.

3.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS orders_in_2019`**:

      * This is the technique of **conditional aggregation**.
      * `YEAR(o.order_date) = 2019`: This checks if the sale occurred in the year 2019.
      * `CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`: If the order was made in 2019, it returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
      * `SUM(...)`: By summing these `1`s and `0`s, we get the total count of orders that satisfy the condition (were made in 2019) for that user group. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that users with no orders will have a calculated sum of `0`.
