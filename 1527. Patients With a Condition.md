-- Solution to find patients who have Type I Diabetes, which always starts with 'DIAB1' prefix.
-- This requires checking for 'DIAB1' at the beginning of the string OR preceded by a space,
-- to ensure it's a separate condition code and not part of another word.

SELECT
    patient_id,
    patient_name,
    conditions
FROM
    Patients
WHERE
    -- The regular expression pattern is structured to match DIAB1 as a distinct condition:
    conditions REGEXP '(^| )DIAB1'
    
    -- Breakdown of the REGEXP:
    -- 1. `(^| )`: Matches either the start of the string (`^`) OR a space character (` `).
    --    This ensures that 'DIAB1' is the beginning of a condition code.
    -- 2. `DIAB1`: The literal prefix for Type I Diabetes.
    
    -- Examples matched:
    -- - 'DIAB100 MYOP' (matches '^DIAB1')
    -- - 'ACNE DIAB100' (matches ' DIAB1')
    -- - 'DIAB1' (matches '^DIAB1')
