## 🧐 Query Explanation


* **`SeasonalSales` CTE**

  * Converts each `sale_date` into a **season** (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall).
  * Groups by `season` and `category`.
  * Computes:

    * `total_quantity` = total units sold in that season.
    * `total_revenue` = total sales amount (quantity × price).

* **`TopCategoryPerSeason` CTE**

  * Ranks categories **within each season** using:

    * Highest `total_quantity` first.
    * Ties broken by highest `total_revenue`.
  * `rk = 1` → top-selling category for that season.

* **Final SELECT**

  * Returns only the **best-selling category** for each season.

* Ordered alphabetically by season (Winter → Spring → Summer → Fall).
