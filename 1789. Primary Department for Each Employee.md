# Problems 1789: Primary Department for Each Employee
![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT
  employee_id,
  department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT
  employee_id,
  department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
```
## 🧐 Query Explanation

* **First SELECT** → Gets employees whose **primary department is marked as 'Y'**.
* `UNION DISTINCT` → Merges results and **removes duplicates**.
* **Second SELECT + HAVING COUNT(*) = 1** → Finds employees who are linked to **only one department** (so it’s automatically their primary).
* `GROUP BY 1` → Groups by **employee_id**.
