```sql
SELECT
    C.name AS Customers
FROM
    Customers C
-- Start with all customers on the left side
LEFT JOIN
    Orders O ON C.id = O.customerId
-- Filter to keep only those rows where there was NO matching order.
-- When a customer has no orders, the columns from the Orders table (O) will be NULL.
WHERE
    O.id IS NULL;
