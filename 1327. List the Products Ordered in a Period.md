## 🧐 Query Explanation


* Inner subquery (`T`):

  * Filters `Orders` to **February 2020**.
  * Groups by `product_id`.
  * Computes each product’s **total units sold** in that month.
  * `HAVING SUM(unit) >= 100` → keeps only products with **100+ units sold**.

* Main query:

  * Joins `Products` with subquery `T` to get the **product_name**.
  * Selects the product name and total units.
