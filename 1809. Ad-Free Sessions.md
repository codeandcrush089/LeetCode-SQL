## 🧐 Query Explanation

* `FROM Playback LEFT JOIN Ads` → Joins **playback sessions with ads**, keeping **all playbacks**.
* `customer_id` match → Links ads to the **same customer**.
* `Ads.timestamp BETWEEN start_time AND end_time` → Checks if an **ad appeared during the session**.
* `WHERE Ads.ad_id IS NULL` → Keeps only sessions **with NO ads shown**.
* `SELECT Playback.session_id` → Returns only the **session IDs**.
