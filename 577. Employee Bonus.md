## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM Employee E`**

Starts with the **Employee** table so every employee is considered.


### **2. `LEFT JOIN Bonus B ON E.empId = B.empId`**

* Joins bonus information to employees.
* Keeps **all employees**, even those **without a bonus record**.
* Employees with no bonus get `NULL` in `B.bonus`.


### **3. `WHERE B.bonus IS NULL`**

Selects employees who **do not have any bonus**.


### **4. `OR B.bonus < 1000`**

Also selects employees whose **bonus exists but is less than 1000**.


### **5. `SELECT E.name, B.bonus`**

Outputs the employee’s **name** and their **bonus amount** (or NULL if none).
