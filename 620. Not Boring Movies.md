## 🧐 Query Explanation

### **1. `FROM Cinema`**

Reads movie records from the `Cinema` table.


### **2. Filter conditions**

```sql
id % 2 = 1
AND description != 'boring'
```

* `id % 2 = 1` → keeps movies with an **odd ID**.
* `description != 'boring'` → excludes movies marked as **boring**.


### **3. `SELECT id, movie, description, rating`**

Returns the movie details and rating.


### **4. `ORDER BY rating DESC`**

Sorts movies by **highest rating first**.
