![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Level-Easy-brightgreen)

```sql
SELECT Employee.employee_id
FROM Employees AS Employee
LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager
  ON (Employee.manager_id = Manager.employee_id)
WHERE
  Employee.salary < 30000
  AND Employee.manager_id IS NOT NULL
  AND Manager.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY 1;
```
## 🧐 Query Explanation

* `LEFT JOIN Employees AS Manager`
  → Matches each employee with their **manager’s record**.

* `Employee.salary < 30000`
  → Employee earns **less than 30k**.

* `Employee.manager_id IS NOT NULL`
  → Employee *should* have a manager.

* `Manager.employee_id IS NULL`
  → The manager **doesn’t exist in the Employees table** (invalid or missing manager).

* `ORDER BY 1`
  → Sort by `employee_id`.
