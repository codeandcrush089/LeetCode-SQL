## 🧐 Query Explanation

* **`ranked_sessions`** → Orders each student’s study sessions by date using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

* **`grouped_sessions`** → Calculates the **day gap** between consecutive study sessions using `LAG()` and `DATEDIFF()`.

* **`session_groups`** → Creates a new **group whenever the gap > 2 days**, meaning a new continuous study streak starts.

* **`valid_sequences`** → Keeps only those streaks where a student has **at least 6 continuous sessions**, and:

  * Builds the **subject sequence** using `GROUP_CONCAT`
  * Calculates **total study hours**

* **`pattern_detected`** → Tries to detect if the **subject sequence is repeating** in a cycle (length 3 or 4):

  * Uses string pattern matching (`LIKE`, `SUBSTRING_INDEX`)
  * Calculates the **cycle length**

* **`final_output`** → Joins detected patterns with the **students table** to fetch:

  * `student_name`, `major`
  * `cycle_length`
  * `total_study_hours`

* **Final `ORDER BY`** → Sorts by:

  * Highest **cycle length first**
  * Then by **total study hours**
